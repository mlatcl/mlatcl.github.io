# ML@CL Group Web Pages

Welcome to the group web pages. 

You can either edit from here via pull request, or you can access using the NetlifyCMS Interface.

The idea is that we can each update information about ourselves or activities in the group on these pages.

Pages are structured into 

 - _research  Our main research themes (we have four of these)
 - _projects  The projects we are working on with these themes
 - _people    Our researchers and students
 - _publications  Our publications
 - _availableprojects  Part II/Part III/MPhil projects proposals and archive
