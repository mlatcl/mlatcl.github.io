  Aspirations for artificial intelligence (AI) as a catalyst for scientific discovery are growing. High-profile successes deploying AI in domains such as protein folding have highlighted AIâ€™s potential to unlock new frontiers of scientific knowledge. However, the pathway from AI innovation to deployment in research is not linear. Those seeking to drive a new wave of scientific progress through the application of AI require a diffusion engine that can enhance AI adoption across disciplines. Lessons from previous waves of technology change, experiences of deploying AI in real-world contexts and an emerging research agenda from the AI for science community suggest a framework for accelerating AI adoption. This framework requires action to build supply chains of ideas between disciplines; rapidly transfer technological capabilities through open research; create AI tools that empower researchers; and embed effective data stewardship. Together, these interventions can cultivate an environment of open data science that deliver the benefits of AI across the sciences.
