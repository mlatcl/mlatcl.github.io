  Computer simulations are becoming an essential tool in many scientific fields 
  from molecular dynamics to aeronautics. In glaciology, future predictions of 
  sea level change require input from ice sheet models. Due to uncertainties in   the forcings and the parameter choices for such models, many different 
  realisations of the model are needed in order to produce probabilistic 
  forecasts of sea level change. For these reasons, producing robust 
  probabilistic forecasts from an ensemble of model simulations over regions 
  of interest can be extremely expensive for many ice sheet models. 
  Multi-fidelity experimental design (MFED) is a strategy that models the 
  high-fidelity output of the simulator by combining information from various 
  resolutions in an attempt to minimize the computational costs of the process 
  and maximize the accuracy of the posterior. In this paper, we present an 
  application of MFED to an ice-sheet simulator and demonstrate potential 
  computational savings by modelling the relationship between spatial 
  resolutions. We also analyze the behavior of MFED strategies using 
  theoretical results from sub-modular maximization.
