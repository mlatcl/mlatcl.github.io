title: Deep Neural Networks as Point Estimates for Deep Gaussian Processes
abstract: Neural networks and Gaussian processes are complementary in their
  strengths and weaknesses. Having a better understanding of their relationship
  comes with the promise to make each method benefit from the strengths of the
  other. In this work, we establish an equivalence between the forward passes of
  neural networks and (deep) sparse Gaussian process models. The theory we develop
  is based on interpreting activation functions as interdomain inducing features
  through a rigorous analysis of the interplay between activation functions and
  kernels. This results in models that can either be seen as neural networks with
  improved uncertainty prediction or deep Gaussian processes with increased
  prediction accuracy. These claims are supported by experimental results on
  regression and classification datasets.
