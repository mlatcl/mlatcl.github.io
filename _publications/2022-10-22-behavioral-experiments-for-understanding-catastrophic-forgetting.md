title: "Behavioral experiments for understanding catastrophic forgetting"
abstract:
    We explore how the fundamental tool of experimental psychology, the behavioral experiment, can generate insight not only into humans and animals, but artificial systems too.
    Using catastrophic forgetting as a case study, we present a series of novel experiments with two-layer non-linear networks, and exploratory results revealing a more nuanced understanding of this complex behavior.
    Alongside our empirical findings, we demonstrate and discuss an alternative, behavior-first approach to investigating emergent neural network phenomena.
