title: "Towards One Model for Classical Dimensionality Reduction: A Probabilistic Perspective on UMAP and t-SNE"
published: 2024-05-27
abstract: |
  This paper shows that the dimensionality reduction methods, UMAP and t-SNE, can be approximately recast as MAP inference methods corresponding to a generalized Wishart-based model introduced in ProbDR. This interpretation offers deeper theoretical insights into these algorithms, while introducing tools with which similar dimensionality reduction methods can be studied.
