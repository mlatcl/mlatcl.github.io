title: "Increasing data sharing and use for social good: Lessons from Africaâ€™s data-sharing practices during the COVID-19 response"
abstract: >
  The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the critical need for timely data
  and information to aid interventions and decision-making. Efforts by
  different actors resulted in various data-driven initiatives,
  constituting experiences of deploying data in the COVID-19 response
  and valuable lessons that can advance the sharing and use of data
  for social good beyond COVID-19. This commentary highlights key case
  studies detailing the experiences and lessons of those who
  implemented data science solutions for the COVID-19 response, as
  well as findings from 74 data-centric COVID-19 interventions. These
  interventions demonstrated successful data access strategies,
  productive intervention processes, and effective stakeholder
  engagement, all of which present potential pathways to overcoming
  data access obstacles across Africa. Additionally, this study also
  briefly explores three areas for action (i.e., institutions, people,
  and platforms) that can inform future policy development to increase
  data sharing for societal benefit in the long term.
