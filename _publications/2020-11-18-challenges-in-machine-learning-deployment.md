title: Challenges in Machine Learning Deployment
abstract: In recent years, machine learning has transitioned from a field of
  academic research interest to a field capable of solving real-world business
  problems. However, the deployment of machine learning models in production
  systems can present a number of issues and concerns. This survey reviews
  published reports of deploying machine learning solutions in a variety of use
  cases, industries and applications and extracts practical considerations
  corresponding to stages of the machine learning deployment workflow. By
  mapping found challenges to the steps of the machine learning deployment
  workflow  we show that practitioners face issues at each stage of the
  deployment process. The goal of this paper is to lay out a research agenda to
  explore approaches addressing these challenges.
