title: Exploring Legal Mechanisms for Data Stewardship
abstract: |
  Organisations, governments and citizen-driven initiatives around the
  world aspire to use data to tackle major societal and economic
  problems, such as combating the COVID-19 pandemic. Realising the
  potential of data for social good is not an easy task, and from the
  outset efforts must be made to develop methods for the responsible
  management of data on behalf of individuals and groups.  Widespread
  misuse of personal data, exemplified by repeated high-profile data
  breaches and sharing scandals, has resulted in 'tenuous' public
  trust in public and private-sector data sharing. Concentration of
  power and market dominance, based on extractive data practices from
  a few technological players, both entrench public concern about data
  use and impede data sharing and access in the public interest. The
  lack of transparency and scrutiny around public-private partnerships
  add additional layers of concerns when it comes to how data is used.

  Part of these concerns comes from the fact that what individuals
  might consider to be 'good' is different to how those who process
  data may define it, especially if individuals have no say in that
  definition.
