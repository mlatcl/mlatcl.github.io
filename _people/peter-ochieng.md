biography: Peter's research involves developing natural language and Audio processing techniques for indigenous African languages. This involves 
exploiting low amount of available dataset to design creative natural Language prcessing techniques that have high precision in translation. For people who cannot read, can we generate audio from text in their language exactly how they speak ? How can the developed techniques be integrated in different agricultural and health applications running on resource constrained gadgets such as mobile phones ?  In the end the goal is to make African society  enjoy the services of differrent applications in the language of their choice.
