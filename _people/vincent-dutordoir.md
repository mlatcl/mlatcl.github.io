biography: >-
	Vincent is a PhD student in the Computational and Biological Learning Lab (CBL)
	with Prof. Zoubin Ghahramani, and in the Machine Learning at Computer Lab
	(ML@CL) with Prof. Carl Henrik Ek. He is also a member of Jesus College,
	University of Cambridge.

	Vincent started his PhD in October 2020. Prior to that, he worked as a research
	scientist at Secondmind. He received his Bachelors (BA) and Masters (MSc) in
	Computer Science Engineering from Ghent University (Belgium) in 2017. Broadly
	speaking, his interests are in models for uncertainty-aware decision making,
	with a special focus on (deep) Gaussian processes and Neural Diffusion
	Processes.
