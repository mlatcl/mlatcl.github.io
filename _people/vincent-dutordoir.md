biography: >-
	Vincent is a PhD student in the Computational and Biological Learning Lab (CBL)
	and the Machine Learning at Computer Lab (ML@CL) groups, supervised by Prof.
	Zoubin Ghahramani and Prof. Carl Henrik Ek. He is also a member of Jesus
	College, University of Cambridge.

	Vincent started his PhD in October 2020. Prior to that, he worked as a research
	scientist at Secondmind. He received his Bachelors and Masters in Computer
	Science Engineering from Ghent University (Belgium) in 2017. Broadly speaking,
	his interests are in models for uncertainty-aware decision making, with a
	special focus on (deep) Gaussian processes and Neural Diffusion Processes.
