  **Technical Title:** Sampling Transition Paths Between Molecular Conformations
  Using Diffusion Bridges and Score Matching.


  Recent advances in Schrodinger Bridges \[1,2] have enabled to learn stochastic mappings between 2 probability distributions (p(x) and q(x)) such that the stochastic map (which is modelled by a diffusion / SDE) is regularised by some prior process (whether it be computational or physical).


  This project seeks to explore these methodologies in particular the simpler case studied in \[3] where both the source and the target distributions are modeled as point masses (dirac delta functions / measures). We seek to apply the approach in \[3] to sampling physically meaningful transition paths between two protein configurations as done in \[4]. Ideally, we would aim to start working with simple/toy proteins and then move on to larger scale tasks where one of the protein configurations is a flat amino-acid and proteins produced by alpha fold, the end product would be to generate a video which gives a physically plausible folding process for alphafold \[5] predictions.


  An example Timeline of the project could be:


  1. Get the codebase of \[4] working and reproduce results on simple proteins.

  2. Extend the work in \[3] to the underdampened version. (Francisco can help with this)

  3. Apply the extensions and adaptions of \[3] to work on the simple proteins of \[4] and compare to the method in \[4]. 

  4. Consider enhancements / extensions, would a full Schrödinger bridge work better here? 

  5. If time allowing, pick some of the most recently exciting discoveries from alphafold \[5] that have a known potential and try and see if we can get it working.


  Point 5. is an "if time allows" type of objective and I predict most the time will be spent in 3., successful completion of 3 could lead to a publication at a top venue whilst 5. could have a broader impact on the field.


  Ideally a good background in the following could be very helpful for this project:


  1. Timeseries models (Kalman filters, AR processes, Gaussian processes).

  2. Introductory calculus (ODEs, Basic PDEs, limits).

  3. Probability Theory (Limit Theorems, Change of Variables, basic concentration inequalities e.g., Markov/Chebyshev)

  4. Variational Inference (MFVI, Amortised VI, Deep hierarchical latent variable models)
