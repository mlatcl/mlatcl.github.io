  You will learn about software design decisions behind the implementation of a
  scalable and flexible system that handles large, heterogeneous, and real time
  data in a city wide environment.


  You will learn about the infrastructure behind data science and machine learning and how to build such infrastructure in a cloud environment.

title: Decision Support for Cities Management
overview: "Smart cities are urban environments where computing devices generate
  considerable amounts of heterogeneous data. Cities' authorities need
  sophisticated platforms to manage and analyse such data before using it. In
  this project you will provide a flexible, scalable, and real time
  decision-support tool for city managers. This tool will manage data from
  heterogeneous sources and provide meaningful insights to city managers to
  support their decisions. "
project_objective: You will provide a decision-support tool for city managers.
  This tool will include flexible data collection mechanisms (e.g., REST API
  clients) to get cities' data from heterogenous sources, data management and
  infrastructure components that store/stream cities' data according to its
  nature (e.g., real time vs non-real time data), data analysis components that
  discover correlations between the cities' data and provide meaningful insights
  for managers, and a visualisation tool that shows such insights.
project_bigger_picture: This project is part of a wider project called AutoAI.
  The aim is to build explainable and maintainable machine learning systems. You
  will have a chance to interact with the wider team and a successful project
  will form part of the portfolio of AutoAI demonstrations.
