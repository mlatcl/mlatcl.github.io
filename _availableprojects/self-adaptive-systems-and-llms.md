  You will learn about autonomous computing and self-adaptive systems, their architecture,
  and how they are used to solve problems in different domains and scenarios.

title: Self-Adaptive Systems and Large Language Models (LLMs)
overview: "Software systems are increasingly complex and include different actors and components interacting
  in dynamic environments. Maintaining such systems is a difficult task where human intervention is not feasible.
  Autonomous computing has explored approaches to optimise systems' performance by changing their structure,
  behaviour, or environment variables. These approaches rely on feedback loops that accumulate knowledge from
  the system interactions to inform autonomous decision-making. However, this knowledge is often limited,
  constraining the systems' interpretability and adaptability."
project_objective: "Rapid advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) open new opportunities to include these tools
  in complex decision-making processes. This project explores the inclusion of LLMs as software agents to make
  self-adaptive decisions by replacing the traditional agents based on Reinforcement Learning (RL). The project's
  first step would be integrating one or more LLM agents into the current self-adaptive systems architecture and
  evaluating their performance in well-known benchmarks (e.g., [SEAMS exemplars](https://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/giese/public/selfadapt/exemplars/),
  [OpenRL](https://wandb.ai/openrlbenchmark/openrlbenchmark/reportlist), etc). You would then compare the LLMs-based
  agent's performance against current baselines. Finally, you would explore possible alternatives to improve the LLMs'
  results with techniques such as Retrieved Augmented Generation (RAG)."
project_bigger_picture: "This project is part of the [Self-Sustaining Software Systems (S4)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11370) 
  research agenda. The goal behind S4 is to enable a new concept for adaptable systems. S4 aims to build knowledge loops
  between different knowledge sources to improve their adaptability."
