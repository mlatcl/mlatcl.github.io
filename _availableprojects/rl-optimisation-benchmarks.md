title: "Optimisation Benchmarks for Online RL"
overview: |-
  Reinforcement Learning algorithms have been applied in different domains. Now there is a growing interest in applying RL algorithms to optimisation problems. Such algorithms are a better alternative to produce near-optimal solutions in dynamic environments, compared against exact or approximation algorithms. Benchmarks are a key element in the development and evaluation of novel algorithms as they enable a standardised comparison of these algorithms' performance. In this project you will provide a set of optimisation benchmarks to evaluate online RL algorithms.

## FAQs

* What will I learn in this Project?

  You will learn about optimisation problems (i.e., resource allocation)  and how they computationally represent real-world problems. You will also learn about the traditional and RL algorithms that solve these problems. 
   
* What is the objective of the project?

  You will provide the code for a set of optimisation problems benchmarks for online RL algorithms based on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10641). These benchmarks include three well-known resource allocation problems (i.e., Bin Packing, Newsvendoor, and Vehicle Routing) with their respective baselines, and evaluation tools (e.g., automated performance graphs). The code must be built in a flexible fashion in a way that the sets of problems or baselines are easily extended in the future.
    
* How does this fit in the bigger picture?

  This project is part of a wider project called AutoAI. The aim is to build explainable and maintainable machine learning systems. You will have a chance to interact with the wider team and a successful project will form part of the portfolio of AutoAI demonstrations.
