student_learn: You will learn about the infrastructure behind data science and
  machine learning and how to build such infrastructures in a cloud environment.
project_objective: You will provide a REST API that will allow researchers to
  explore academic research papers. There is flexibility, and you might provide
  data visualization tools in e.g. Bokeh that allow different views on the data.
project_bigger_picture: This project is part of a wider project called AutoAI.
  The aim is to build explainable and maintainable machine learning systems. You
  will have a chance to interact with the wider team and a successful project
  will form part of the portfolio of AutoAI demonstrations.
