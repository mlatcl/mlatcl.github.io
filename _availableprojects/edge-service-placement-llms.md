  You will learn about optimising edge computing architectures in urban environments.
  Such optimisation will include integrating LLMs into complex decision-making processes, 
  and benchmarking their behaviour in a simulation environment.

title: Edge Service Placement based on Large Language Models (LLMs)
overview: "Edge computing architectures propose placing software services closer to end users. 
This distributed placement can enable super-low latency, data-intensive applications that can 
benefit domains as diverse as virtual reality, gaming, and healthcare. The decision of what 
services to deploy in which edge is an optimisation problem called service placement. Solutions 
to the service placement problem must consider latency requirements and resource constraints while 
assigning services to edge servers in an automatic fashion. Exact, approximation, heuristics, and 
meta-heuristic algorithms are traditional approaches to solving such an optimisation problem. 
However, service placement is still an active research area."
project_objective: "Rapid advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) open new opportunities to include 
these tools in complex decision-making processes. This project explores the inclusion of LLMs as software 
agents that address the service placement problem. The project's first step would be integrating one or 
more LLM agents within our simulation environment. You would then compare the LLMs-based service placement 
performance using [our previous studies](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9681330). Finally, 
you would explore possible alternatives to improve the LLMs' results with techniques such as Retrieved 
Augmented Generation (RAG)."
project_bigger_picture: "This project is part of the [Self-Sustaining Software Systems (S4)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11370) 
research agenda, and it is part of a collaboration with researchers from Trinity College Dublin. The goal behind 
S4 is to enable a new concept for adaptable systems. S4 aims to build knowledge loops between different knowledge
sources to improve their adaptability."
