abstract: |-
  Technologies that were previously only available to elite athletes are becoming widespread. Now casual athletes can buy systems that monitor pace, heart rate and other information for under 300 pounds. This project will build a software tool for analysis of data of this type. Software for the project will be written according to the principles of open data science.
  
  This project will suit students with strong analytical skills, there will be a focus on linear algebra and probabilistic inference in the software.
