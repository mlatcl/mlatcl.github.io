title: Motion Capture Data Modelling in Python
overview: |-
  The Python programming language is becoming a de facto standard for implementation of machine learning algorithms. This project will develop tools for modelling of motion capture data in the Python programming language. Based on existing tools in MATLAB, the aim of the project will be to port the underlying machine learning techniques to the more powerful Python programming language. The end aim is to provide a simple tool for animators to model motion capture data and create new animations for computer games or the film industry.
  
  A previous project has built a visualization framework for motion capture data, this year’s project will focus on more advanced machine learning methodologies. The student will work with an ongoing software development framework being developed by the machine learning group. Software for the project will be written according to the principles of open data science.
  
  This project will suit students with strong analytical skills, there will be a focus on linear algebra and probabilistic inference in the software.
