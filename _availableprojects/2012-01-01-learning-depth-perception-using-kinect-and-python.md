title: Learning Depth Perception using Kinect and Python
layout: project-to-supervise
status: Hidden
year: 2014
overview: |-
  Kinect cameras provide true image and an associated depth image. These two images are providing different information, yet a human can infer depth directly from an image. This project will focus on using machine learning techniques building on the machine learning groups python code to see what can be learnt about depth from images. The ultimate aim will be to reconstruct the depth in a real image by learning about depths from information provided by the Kinect camera. Software for the project will be written according to the principles of open data science.
  
  This project will suit students with strong analytical skills, there will be a focus on linear algebra and probabilistic inference in the software.
