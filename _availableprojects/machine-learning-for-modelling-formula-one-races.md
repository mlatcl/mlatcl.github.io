overview: >-
  The machine learning group is working with one of the leading forumla one
  teams in analysis of data generated in Formula One races with the aim of
  improving strategy. With this aim we are running one or more projects this
  year focussed on Formula One data. Formula one is a data intensive sport,
  information about the location of each teamâ€™s car during the race is provided
  to the teams. Optimization of pit stop strategy can make the difference
  between winning and losing the race.

  There are commercial confidentiality issues over which areas will be studied, but interested students can discuss these areas directly with the supervisors.

student_learn: You will learn about making real time data-driven decisions using
  machine learning. You will develop an understanding of how the pipeline of
  decision making depends on good software, how to interact with a customer who
  needs to take action on those decisions.

project_objective: Project objectives vary according to current priorities for
  the team. Past project objectives have included providing estimates of
  qualifying cut off lap times (including uncertainties) and estimating the
  sensitivities of the race simulation.
project_bigger_picture: In academia it is rare to find a decision-making
  environment where the decision is based on the best-available knowledge, more
  often we are looking to give a developed understanding of a problem without
  time pressure. Strategy in Formula One races requires that the
  best-currently-available answer is provided and this project gives an
  opportunity to understand that process.
