overview: The use of machine learning models both in academia and industry is on the rise.
  And so is the environmental impact of ML models. While deploying a model to production, it is important
  to be able to estimate its carbon footprint and to understand the costs involved in running it.
  Balancing performance and carbon efficiency of ML models becomes critical
  to ensure that the benefits of ML are maximized while minimizing its environmental costs.
  This project proposes to develop a procedure that automatically discovers and quantifies this trade-off.

student_learn: You will learn about multi-objective optimisation. You will learn
  how to estimate the energy consumption of software code.
  You will learn about Bayesian optimization and learn how to apply it to practical tasks.
  You will gain experience of building models using the PyTorch library.
project_objective: The goal of the project is to implement a procedure of
  building a 2D Pareto front between utility and energy consumption
  for ML models. We suggest using BoTorch for multi-objective optimization
  but other tools can also be considered. Once the implementation is in place,
  experiments on different models and datasets will be run. The final step of the project
  is to analyse the discovered trade-offs.

  This project is part of a wider effort called AutoAI, which aim is to build
  explainable and maintainable machine learning systems. You will have a chance
  to interact with the wider team and a successful project will form part of the
  portfolio of AutoAI demonstrations. We will also encourage publication of the
  project's result.

  This idea continues the line of work done by our research team of applying multi-objective Bayesian optimisation to study trade-offs involved in building ML models: [2D utility/privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10862), [3D utility/privacy/fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15691).
