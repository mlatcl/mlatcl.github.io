title: Machine Learning for Modelling Formula One Races
abstract: |-
  The machine learning group is working with one of the leading forumla one teams in analysis of data generated in Formula One races with the aim of improving strategy. With this aim we are running one or more projects this year focussed on Formula One data. Formula one is a data intensive sport, information about the location of each team’s car during the race is provided to the teams. Optimization of pit stop strategy can make the difference between winning and loosing the race.
  
  There are commercial confidentiality issues over which areas will be studied, but interested students can discuss these areas directly with Professor Lawrence.
  
  This project will suit students with strong analytical skills, there will be a focus on linear algebra and probabilistic inference in the software.
