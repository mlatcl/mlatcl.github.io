While excitement about the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies continues to build, a gap is emerging between our aspirations for the benefits of AI and our ability to deploy these technologies to tackle real-world challenges.

The AutoAI Programme scales our ability to deploy safe and reliable AI solutions, driving innovation in machine learning-enabled techniques for deploying, maintaining, and understanding AI systems. By investigating how to decompose AI systems into their component parts, how to manage data in system development, and how to monitor performance in deployment, AutoAI will develop a new AI design and engineering paradigm.

These innovations require research advances to develop more sophisticated machine learning models and integrate them in wider systems, new types of infrastructure and programming techniques to solve technical challenges at scale, a shift towards data-oriented technical infrastructures and organisational practices, and wider organisational, legal and policy interventions to influence AI adoption.Â 

AutoAI will address the entire pipeline of AI system development, from data acquisition to decision making. It will develop policies that enable trustworthy access to data, build effective research collaborations that embed stakeholder needs in research design, and promote an open culture of AI and software engineering.
